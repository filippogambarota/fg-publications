  unattended emotional facial expressions, only a minority of studies have
  investigated the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) of emotions
  conveyed by faces. In the present high-density electroencephalography (EEG)
  study, we first employed a staircase procedure to identify each participant's
  perceptual threshold of the emotion expressed by the face and then compared
  the EEG signals elicited in trials where the participants were aware with the
  activity elicited in trials where participants were unaware of the emotions
  expressed by these, otherwise identical, faces. Drawing on existing knowledge
  of the neural mechanisms of face processing and NCCs, we hypothesized that
  activity in frontal electrodes would be modulated in relation to participants'
  awareness of facial emotional content. More specifically, we hypothesized that
  the NCC of fear seen on someone else's face could be detected as a modulation
  of a later and more anterior (i.e., at frontal sites) event-related potential
  (ERP) than the face-sensitive N170. By adopting a data-driven approach and
  cluster-based statistics to the analysis of EEG signals, the results were
  clear-cut in showing that visual awareness of fear was associated with the
  modulation of a frontal ERP component in a 150-300 msec interval. These
  insights are dissected and contextualized in relation to prevailing theories
  of visual consciousness and their proposed NCC benchmarks.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent decades, numerous studies have investigated
  the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive
  functioning. However, results of these studies frequently display
  inconsistency and pose challenges regarding replicability. The present work
  aimed at testing the hypothesis of mood as potential moderator of prefrontal
  tDCS effects on executive functions (EF). This hypothesis refers to the
  relationship between mood and EF, as well as to the association of mood with
  the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity. METHODS: We conducted a
  meta-analysis of 11 articles where the dlPFC was stimulated with anodal tDCS,
  EF were measured, and mood was assessed prior to the stimulation. We then
  conducted a meta-regression to examine whether mood moderated the tDCS effects
  on EF. RESULTS: While no significant effect of tDCS on EF emerged from the
  meta-analysis, the meta-regression indicated that mood plays a significant
  role as moderator, with greater tDCS effects on EF in individuals with higher
  depressive symptoms. LIMITATIONS: The limited number of studies included, the
  heterogeneous samples considered, and the limited generalizability to other
  non-invasive brain stimulation techniques and affective states. CONCLUSIONS:
  Findings suggest that evaluating mood prior to stimulation could increase the
  sensitivity and specificity of tDCS application, and provide the first
  meta-analytic evidence in favor of the affective state-dependency hypothesis.},

  ways for simulating data as a function of predictors showing a 2 × 2
  interaction with categorical predictors and the interaction between a numeric
  and categorical predictor. Finally, we showed an example of power analysis

  On each trial, female participants (N = 32) were exposed to a rivalrous pair

  glasses in two conditions: in one, they could freely use their facial mimicry,
  in the other they had to keep a chopstick between their lips, constraining the
  mobility of the zygomatic muscle and producing 'noise' for sensorimotor
  simulation. We found that blocking facial mimicry affected the perceptual
  dominance in terms of cumulative time favoring neutral faces, but it did not
  change the time before the first dominance was established. Taken together,

  Two S1-S2 paradigms were used as learning and test phases. S1s were colored
  circles, S2s negative/neutral affective pictures or sounds. During the

  congruency between visual stimuli. During the test phase, participants were
  presented with a new 75\% S1-S2 paradigm and visual (Experiment 1) or auditory
  (Experiment 2) S2s. Participants were asked to rate the expected valence of
  upcoming S2s (expectancy ratings) or valence and arousal to S2s. In both
  experiments, the CG reported more extreme expectancy ratings than the UG,
  suggesting that experiencing previous reliable S1-S2 associations led CG
  participants to subsequently predict similar associations. No group
  differences emerged on valence and arousal ratings, which were more
  prominently influenced by the new 75\% contingencies of the test phase rather
  than by previous learned contingencies. Last, comparing the two experiments,
  no significant group by experiment interaction was found, supporting the

  abstract = {With the advent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-Corona
  Virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, the theme of emotion recognition from
  facial expressions has become highly relevant due to the widespread use of
  face masks as one of the main devices imposed to counter the spread of the
  virus. Unsurprisingly, several studies published in the last 2 years have
  shown that accuracy in the recognition of basic emotions expressed by faces
  wearing masks is reduced. However, less is known about the impact that wearing
  face masks has on the ability to recognize emotions from subtle expressions.
  Furthermore, even less is known regarding the role of interindividual
  differences (such as alexithymic and autistic traits) in emotion processing.
  This study investigated the perception of all the six basic emotions (anger,
  disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise), both as a function of the
  face mask and as a function of the facial expressions' intensity (full vs.
  subtle) in terms of participants' uncertainty in their responses,
  misattribution errors, and perceived intensity. The experiment was conducted
  online on a large sample of participants (N = 129). Participants completed the
  20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale and the Autistic Spectrum Quotient and then
  performed an emotion-recognition task that involved face stimuli wearing a
  mask or not, and displaying full or subtle expressions. Each face stimulus was
  presented alongside the Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW), and participants had to
  indicate what emotion they believed the other person was feeling and its
  intensity using the GEW. For each combination of our variables, we computed
  the indices of 'uncertainty' (i.e., the spread of responses around the correct
  emotion category), 'bias' (i.e., the systematic errors in recognition), and
  'perceived intensity' (i.e., the distance from the center of the GEW). We
  found that face masks increase uncertainty for all facial expressions of
  emotion, except for fear when intense, and that disgust was systematically
  confused with anger (i.e., response bias). Furthermore, when faces were
  covered by the mask, all the emotions were perceived as less intense, and this
  was particularly evident for subtle expressions. Finally, we did not find any
  evidence of a relationship between these indices and alexithymic/autistic
  traits.},

  Common risks include not only failing to detect existing clusters due to a

  Simple data simulations suggest that under conditions of sample size, number,

  In the latest model of sensorimotor simulation, an iterative communication
  between somatosensory, motor/premotor cortices, and visual regions has been
  proposed, which should allow more efficient discriminations among subtle
  facial expressions. Accordingly, individuals with congenital facial motor
  disability, specifically with MBS, should exhibit atypical communication

  simulation models. We estimated the functional connectivity between the visual
  cortices for face processing and the sensorimotor cortices in healthy and MBS

  connectivity between these two systems using high-density EEG, combined with a
  change detection task with facial expressions (and a control condition
  involving non-face stimuli). The results supported our hypothesis such that
  when discriminating subtle facial expressions, participants affected by
  congenital facial palsy (compared to healthy controls) showed reduced
  connectivity strength between sensorimotor regions and visual regions for face
  processing. This effect was absent for the condition with non-face stimuli.

  abstract = {People use their previous experience to predict future affective
  events. Since we live in ever-changing environments, affective predictions
  must generalize from past contexts (from which they may be implicitly learned)
  to new, potentially ambiguous contexts. This study investigated how past
  (un)certain relationships influence subjective experience following new
  ambiguous cues, and whether past relationships can be learned implicitly. Two
  S1-S2 paradigms were employed as learning and test phases in two experiments.
  S1s were colored circles, S2s negative or neutral affective pictures.
  Participants (Experiment 1 N = 121, Experiment 2 N = 116) were assigned to the
  certain (CG) or uncertain group (UG), and they were presented with 100\% (CG)
  or 50\% (UG) S1-S2 congruency during an uninstructed (Experiment 1) or
  implicit (Experiment 2) learning phase. During the test phase both groups were
  presented with a new 75\% S1-S2 paradigm, and ambiguous (Experiment 1) or
  unambiguous (Experiment 2) S1s. Participants were asked to rate the expected
  valence of upcoming S2s (expectancy ratings), or their experienced valence and
  arousal (valence and arousal ratings). In Experiment 1 ambiguous cues elicited
  less negative expectancy ratings, and less unpleasant valence ratings,
  independently of prior experience. In Experiment 2, both groups showed similar
  expectancies, predicting upcoming pictures’ valence according to the 75\%
  contingencies of the test phase. Overall, we found that in the presence of
  ambiguous cues subjective affective experience is dampened, and that implicit
  previous experience does not emerge at the subjective level by significantly
  shaping reported affective experience.},

  abstract = {Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, including
  transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical
  stimulation (tES), have provided valuable insights into the role of the
  cerebellum in cognitive processes. However, replicating findings from studies
  involving cerebellar stimulation poses challenges. This meta-analysis
  investigates the impact of NIBS on cognitive processes associated with the
  cerebellum. We conducted a systematic search and analyzed 66 studies and 91
  experiments involving healthy adults who underwent either TMS or transcranial
  direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting the cerebellum. The results
  indicate that anodal tDCS applied to the medial cerebellum enhances cognitive
  performance. In contrast, high-frequency TMS disrupts cognitive performance
  when targeting the lateral cerebellar hemispheres or when employed in online
  protocols. Similarly, low-frequency TMS and continuous theta burst stimulation
  (cTBS) diminish performance in offline protocols. Moreover, high-frequency TMS
  impairs accuracy. By identifying consistent effects and moderators of
  modulation, this meta-analysis contributes to improving the replicability of
  studies using NIBS on the cerebellum and provides guidance for future research
  aimed at developing effective NIBS interventions targeting the cerebellum.},
